            The current system is not recognized as supported for automatic overdrive configuration.
            You may attempt to enable overclocking from LACT, but a manual initramfs regeneration may be required for it to take effect.
            If that fails, a fallback option is to add <b>amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff</b> as a boot parameter in your bootloader.

nvidia-oc-info = Nvidia Overclocking Information
nvidia-oc-description = 
    Overclocking functionality on Nvidia includes setting offsets for GPU/VRAM clockspeeds and limiting the potential range of clockspeeds using the "locked clocks" feature.

    On many cards, the VRAM clockpeed offset will only affect the actual memory clockspeed by half of the offset value.
    For example, a +1000MHz VRAM offset may only increase the measured VRAM speed by 500MHz.
    This is normal, and is how Nvidia handles GDDR data rates. Adjust your overclock accordingly.

    Direct voltage control is not supported, as it does not exist in the Nvidia Linux driver.

    It is possible to achieve a pseudo-undervolt by combining the locked clocks option with a positive clockspeed offset.
    This will force the GPU to run at a voltage that's constrained by the locked clocks, while achieving a higher clockspeed due to the offset.
    This can cause system instability if pushed too high.
